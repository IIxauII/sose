# Configs folder

This folder contains configuration data which is potentially individual for each project setup.

It contains files marked with `.example`. These should be adjusted and the correct data entered, then renamed and the `.example` substring of the filename removed.

### TODO:
* maybe create node.js service for fetching config data instead of importing file directly into each solution which requires it
* maybe create node.js service for fetching help / information about the configuration file you want to consume / information about the available configuration files
